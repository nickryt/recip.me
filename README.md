# recip.me 🍪
This project is a recipe storage application for Android devices.
This was started as a side project to expand my knowledge in app development and non-relational databases. I chose to use Google Firebase's Realtime Database and Google Firebase Storage to store user information, recipes, and images. This app was not published to the Google Play store.
